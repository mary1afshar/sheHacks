# Mission
Waste-ed (waste-education) is targeted towards children ages 6-13. Our goal is to educate children about sustainability and to encourage future citizens to maintain eco-friendly habits.

# Inspiration
Our game is inspired by the difficulties we've found ourselves and noticed around us when recycling items correctly. Many of us choose to throw away most items or recycle items that are not supposed to be (also called wish cycling). This is especially prevalent with children, where the decision of where to put a used item may appear to be too taxing, resulting in missorted waste. With this game, we hope that users may find recycling to be more sustainable and instinctive, resulting in reduced blockages in recycling centers and a smaller carbon footprint.
